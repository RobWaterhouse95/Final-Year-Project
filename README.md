# Final-Year-Project
A repository for my final year project of university. Entitled "Network Latency Tool".

Quick Start Guide:
Use the batch file in the /Final Source/ folder to open the 2 clients and 1 tool applications needed to run the demonstration.
Use the tool to listen on 2 ports, 25565 and 25566 are already written in.
Use the clients to connect to each 'end' of the tool.
Once the tool is connected to either client, mouseover the 'mini display' buttons to simualte data going through a connection.
Use the tool's UI to configure packet loss and latency to the connection.
